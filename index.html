	<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>	
	<p>
	Hi<br>
	My name is Yoav Epelman. I am 47 years old. I work as a QA manager for many years.<br>
	I decided to take the Automation course to improve my hands on skills in automation.<br>
	My work experience includes both corporates as well as startups, such as the companies below. Working in all these companies helped me better understanding the QA abd Automation world.

	</ul>

	One (strange :-) ) hobby that I have is exploring my family roots. 
	I started a project of creating a family tree, 25 years ago, and today I have more than 1,000 persons that are either blood relatives or their spouses in my tree. 
	I am doing this using the help of few distant cousings I have around the world and together we reached to our earliest root which is somewhere in the late 1,700s'.
	We are working hard to understand where our ancestors came from. It is hard because there are not a lot of records from these years and it is very challanging to find connections between people in the tree from these years.
